*****


## Some Usage examples
Run simple TCP port scan
```
$redbean -ip 192.168.0.0/24 -ports 80,443
```

Run service scan for top 1K ports. This is the default behaviour if no specific ports are specified   
```
$redbean -ip 192.168.0.1 -probe
```

Run TCP portscan against list of IP addresses and ports
```
$redbean -ipfile ~/iplist.txt -portsfile ~/wordlist/65k-ports.txt
```

Run vulnerability scan against target. Also run analysis using artificial-intelligence.
```
$redbean -ip 192.168.0.1 -vscan -category 6
```

Query OpenAI GPT4.
```
$redbean -gptassist "How to fix SQLi vulnerabilities?"
```

PORT SCANNING:                                                             
   -ip          IP address or CIDR range to scan            
   -ports       Comma-separated list of ports to scan (e.g. -ports 21,22,80,443)
   -portsfile   File containing list of ports to scan (e.g. -portsfile ~/.tmp/top1k-ports.txt)
   -ipfile      File containing list of IP addresses to scan (e.g. -ipfile ~/.tmp/iplist.txt)
   -timeout     Scan timeout in milliseconds. Default is 200  (e.g. -timeout 500)
   -threads     Number of threads to use for scanning. Default is 30 (e.g. -threads 50)
   -probe       Probe open ports to determine running service
   -sploit      Search for Metasploit POC when used with -probe flag
   -proxy       Use SOCKS proxy address (e.g., socks5://127.0.0.1:9050). (limited functionalities)
   -udp         Run a UDP port scan. (best-effort)
   -update      Run an update. Ignores all the other flags

VULNERABILITY SCANNING:                                                     
   -vscan     Scans for vulnerabilities.

AI RISK/IMPACT ANALYSIS:
   -azgpt      Use Azure OpenAI Service over default OpenAI (ChatGPT)

   -category   Asset Category to support AI risk guided analysis (e.g., -category 1)
               Valid values:
               1 - Publicly Exposed. Business Critical (Default)
               2 - Publicly Exposed. Important but not Business Critical
